COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI), a leading Degree Awarding Institution of higher education in Pakistan, is among the Centers of Excellence
of Commission on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the South (COMSATS) www.comsats.org. Established in 1998, CUI is one
of the fast growing research - based institutions in Pakistan, with a wide range of academic programs (ranging from basic
sciences to cutting edge emerging technologies) and a network of inter-disciplinary research centers making it an ideal place for higher
studies leading to MS and PhD degrees. Since its establishment, CUI has made multi-faceted growth in terms of campuses (currently
it has eight fully functional campuses), number of students, faculty members, academic programs, research output, and public outreach, to accomplish
its three-fold stated mission, i.e., Research and Discovery, Teaching and Learning, and Outreach and Public Service, which makes it a
popular choice for undergraduate as well as graduate programs. Further, CUI is currently ranked at Number 03 position in General
Universities of Pakistan, at Number 01 position in Computer Science and IT and has also been ranked Number 02 in
Research Productivity in Pakistan as announced by Higher Education Commission (HEC Ranking 2015, issued in February 2016). Recently, CUI has
also been ranked among top 250 Asian Universities as well. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2019 includes more
than 1,250 universities and COMSATS is only University from Pakistan ranked 600-800 in overall ranking. COMSATS is also ranked 401-500
in the 2019 THE Computer Science Subject Ranking and ranked 301-400 in the 2019 THE Engineering and Technology Subject Ranking.
Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) is considered among the three most authentic and widely revered university rankings besides QS
World University Rankings and Times Higher Education World University Rankings. It is published by the Shanghai Ranking consultancy. Only four
Pakistani universities made it to the ARWU 2018 Rankings, but each remained far away from the elusive top 500 club.
The top ranked Pakistani university in the list was COMSATS University, placed in the 601-700 band of the ranking. As
per QS Universities ranking COMSATS was the second best Pakistani university on the list, claiming a place in the 401-450
band in the engineering and technology broad category. The university scored highly for the number of citations per paper and
academic reputation. During the last 15 years, CUI has witnessed a phenomenal growth to an extent that it would perhaps
not be out of place to say that CUI has been one of the fastest growing educational institutions of the
decade. All through these years, various external bodies have evaluated CUI and the quality of its programs, based on very
stringent quality and professional standards. The most important independent entities and regulatory bodies evaluating CUI and its programs are the
Higher Education Commission (HEC), the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC), National Computing Education Accreditation Council (NCEAC), and the Institute of Scientific
Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge. It is a matter of pride for the CUI that it has been able to
record remarkable achievements in terms of ranking of its Engineering degree programs as well as research productivity of the faculty
members. The various rankings, year wise are listed below for the interest of CUI stakeholders. In February 2016, University Rankings
for the year 2015 were announced by HEC. CUI has been ranked at No.3 in the General Category, and at
