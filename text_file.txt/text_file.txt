of interest-free study loans for bright indigent students. This assistance is subject to renewal every semester in light of the
student’s academic performance. Financial assistance is limited to tuition fee only and is discontinued if the student’s CGPA falls below
the minimum specified to avoid warning. Loan recipients MUST take full load of courses offered. Applicants desirous of seeking study
loan should apply for this purpose on the prescribed form available from all campuses or downloadable from the University web
site. The repayment of loan starts three months after graduation or soon after getting employment, whichever is earlier. The total
amount has to be repaid within a period of four years after graduation. Students are required to sign a contract
allowing future employers to deduct loan repayments at source and remit it to the University. FAST-House Rohtas Road, G-9/4 Islamabad
