### Key Components

- **Mistral-7b-instruct v0.3 LLM**: Utilized for text generation.
- **Langchain Library**: Used for prompt engineering and RAG application development.
- **Chroma DB**: Employed as a vector database for storing data.
- **Transformer Embedding**: Ensures quick document search within the database.
- **Streamlit**: Provides a user-friendly front end to display responses effectively.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we leverage the Mistral-7b-instruct model alongside the Langchain framework. The technique applied here is RAG, focusing on contextual training of LLMs rather than traditional fine-tuning.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):

### What is RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation is a technique that enhances the capabilities of LLMs by providing contextual training, as opposed to the traditional method of fine-tuning. 

### Advantages of RAG
- **Contextual Training**: Provides more relevant and accurate responses by incorporating external data.
- **Flexibility**: Allows the model to adapt to new information without the need for extensive retraining.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time and computational resources required for fine-tuning.

With "Conversify AI," users can experience a seamless and efficient way to interact with web content, making it a powerful tool for extracting and summarizing information, answering questions, and more.
