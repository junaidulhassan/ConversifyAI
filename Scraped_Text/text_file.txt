Queue Data Structure A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data
in a specific order. It follows the principle of “ First in, First out ” (FIFO) , where the first
element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues are commonly used in various algorithms and
applications for their simplicity and efficiency in managing data flow. Queue Data Structure Table of Content A queue is a
linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It operates like a line where elements are added at one
end ( rear ) and removed from the other end ( front ). Queues can be implemented using Two techniques:

Data Structure Hard Problems on Queue Data Structure What is Queue in Data Structures? A queue is a linear data
structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It operates like a line where elements are added at one end (
rear ) and removed from the other end ( front ). Basic Operations of Queue Data Structure Enqueue (Insert) :
Adds an element to the rear of the queue. Dequeue (Delete) : Removes and returns the element from the front
of the queue. Peek : Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it. Empty : Checks
if the queue is empty. Full : Checks if the queue is full. Applications of Queue Task scheduling in operating
systems Data transfer in network communication Simulation of real-world systems (e.g., waiting lines) Priority queues for event processing queues for
event processing Implementation of Queues Queues can be implemented using Two techniques: Implementations of Queue Data Structure using Arrays Implementations
